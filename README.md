## Featured Projects

### Wrinkle Witch CRM (Core Platform)
> A modular Streamlit-based business management platform built for a real skincare business, **The Wrinkle Witch**.  
> Originally designed as a searchable esthetician product database, the CRM evolved into a foundation for managing clients, referrals, and other salon operations.  
> Future modules include Square API integration, client analytics, and routine suggestions.

- **Tech:** Python · Streamlit · Pandas · SQLite · CSV I/O  
- **Highlights:** Modular architecture, searchable product catalog, persistent data pipelines, and Square integration planning  
- *(Private repository, code available upon request)*  

---

### Referral Tracker Module
> The newest module in the Wrinkle Witch CRM ecosystem — a standalone Streamlit app that automates referral tracking, rewards, PDF card creation, and batch exports for marketing use.  
> Represents the transition from single-purpose CRM scripts to reusable, scalable modules integrated with the main platform.

- **Tech:** Python · Streamlit · Pandas · Pillow · FPDF  
- **Highlights:** Modular codebase, automated PDF generation, referral logic, session-state control, and CSV synchronization  
- *(Private repository, code available upon request)*  


### Agricultural Forecasting Dashboard
> A data-science project focused on predicting tomato crop yields using regression and ARIMA modeling.  
> Includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), time-series forecasting, and Matplotlib visualizations.

- **Tech:** Python · Pandas · Scikit-Learn · Matplotlib · Statsmodels  
- **Highlights:** Parameter tuning for ARIMA (p,d,q), error analysis (RMSE / R²), multi-crop comparisons  

---

### Continuous Learning AI Framework
> An experimental Python project modeling how an AI could evolve knowledge and moral rules over time.  
> Includes checkpointing, rollback logic, and modular “knowledge bases” for adaptive behavior.

- **Tech:** Python · JSON · Modular Design · Persistent Storage  
- **Focus:** AI safety, dynamic memory, and rule-based evolution  
- *(Private repository, demo available on request)*

---

### Toy Blockchain
> A minimal blockchain prototype in Python demonstrating proof-of-work, transaction queues, and networking fundamentals.  
> Designed to learn basics and application of crypto technologies.

- **Tech:** Python · Flask · Hashlib · JSON  
- **Highlights:** Block validation, unconfirmed transaction pool, node-based sync logic  
- *(Private repository, demo available on request)*  

---

### Power BI Dashboard (Non-Profit Analytics)
> Designed a Power BI dashboard for a small non-profit organization to visualize outreach and donation performance.  
> Built around a generated sample dataset with metrics for donor activity, event participation, and volunteer engagement.  
> Structured for scalability — can easily integrate with Azure SQL or other live data sources.

- **Tools:** Power BI · KPI Visuals · Interactive Filters  
- **Highlights:** End-to-end dashboard design, data modeling for scalability, intuitive layout for organizational reporting

## Supporting Projects

#### Local LLM Testing & Fine-Tuning
> Ongoing experimentation with running and fine-tuning local language models such as **Phi-2** (8-bit quantization) and **Mistral-7B (4-bit)** using **LoRA/QLoRA** parameter-efficient methods.  
> Explores model setup, quantization, embeddings, and retrieval workflows on local hardware.  

- **Tools:** PyTorch · BitsAndBytes · PEFT · Transformers  
- **Highlights:** LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning workflows, dataset preparation, local inference optimization  

---

#### VS Code & Git Automations
> Created custom Git integration scripts and workspace configurations to streamline development across **Streamlit**, **data-science**, and **LLM** projects.  
> Includes version-controlled repo scaffolding, Jupytext syncing, and automated virtual-environment setup.  

- **Tools:** Git · GitHub · VS Code · Jupytext · Python Virtual Environments  
- **Highlights:** Automated repo scaffolding, github workflows, improved dev-environment consistency, notebook-to-script synchronization
